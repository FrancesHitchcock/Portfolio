                <p>I am a front-end developer who lives close to the market town of Halesworth in Suffolk, UK. With a career background in education and admin I first took up coding in 2020 as a lockdown hobby. Inspired by its opportunities for creativity and problem-solving, coding soon became my passion, and in 2021 I left my job in admin to devote more time to learning front-end skills.</p>

                <p>I have studied coding independently, without recourse to bootcamps, and have used a variety of resources to gain a broad range of skills. I have undertaken numerous projects during this time, including two websites which are live on the World Wide Web.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding I like to spend my time walking in the great outdoors, visiting sites of natural and cultural interest, and reading good novels. </p>

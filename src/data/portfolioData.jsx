        description: (<><p>This was a brainteaser of a React project (for the developer, not just the player), and this was borne out by many posts on the Scrimba Discord channel for this module. This quizz app calls on the Open Trivia Database API for question and answer data. The JavaScript then selects aspects of this data to produce an array of question objects, each with four anwers, one of which is marked as correct using a boolean.</p><p>Most of the state variables and main functionality is situated in the top &lt;App /&gt; component and drilled down to the consuming components via props. The hardest part was setting the questionData state within the selectAnswer() function, as this involved passing the function down the tree where it is realised as a callback function and receives two id parameters - one for the question attempted and one for the selected answer. The state array is updated within the function using a map() within a map().</p><p>The app provides the user with three difficulty levels which they choose from using a select box in the &lt;Start /&gt; component. The value is then added to the http request as a query parameter. Additional functionality includes all three incorrect answers highlighted in red for a question where the user has not selected any answer.</p><p>Potential improvements include the addition of a "chosen subject" select box and corresponding query parameter.</p></>),

        description: (<><p>Based on the traditional family game, this project was a great opportunity to devise a comprehensive algorithm that checked every square in a grid to see if it was held, and if so to check each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line starting at the occupied square to see if the first four (or selected winning line length) were held by the same player.</p><p>The grid was constructed using a for loop within a for loop to create a 2-dimensional matrix. The grid dimensions were set using the JavaScript style property in combination with CSS grid to make the game scalable according to the user's selected dimensions. The user experience is enhanced with a token-drop effect produced by the disc appearing briefly in each square when the token is "dropped". This effect is handled by the dropDisc() function, and I was delighted to get it working! I used a setTimeout() within a for loop, incrementing the setTimeout() interval on each iteration.</p><p>The project focuses on JavaScript logic, and has minimal responsiveness. Opportunities for improvement include styling the app to suit a mobile phone screen, introducing code to indicate which is the winning line of tokens, and adding functionality to allow a single player to play against the computer, with the computer dropping tokens randomly. </p><p>I learnt a lot about JavaScript from this project, including what happens when you try and get it to evaluate array items that lie outside the matrix!</p></>),

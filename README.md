# Portfolio Website

## Background

The layout of my portfolio was inspired by a Scrimba example. The main CSS including animated hamburger, slide-in menu and layout of the introduction sections were adopted from the Scrimba code-along exercise. The style has been personalised with my own choice of colours, fonts, and font-sizes etc. Significant adaptations include structuring the app as a React SPA (which is entirely my work), the layout of the project tiles and Project component, and the addition of a Contact component. The projects are of course all my own. 

User experience was enhanced as follows:
- Scroll restoration using session storage when the user returns from an individual project to the main page.
- Back and forward arrow buttons at the bottom of the project page so the user can navigate backwards and forwards between the projects without having to return to the main page.

## Reflections

- This was a great exercise in CSS. I adopted the approach of using custom properties, and have already used this technique in another project.
- I am so impressed by animated hamburger icons that I might try and design some of my own!
- The original Scrimba design used the BEM naming conventions, which I did not use as I had already started on the layout without them. However, this is something to investigate for future projects.
